# Notes
These are my notes that I have made over books, for prep, and for a plethora of different reasons. The pdf files of these notes are available of my [website](https://anonscholar.github.io)


These were complied using lualatex, and I cannot gurantee that they will work for anything other than that. The License file is for the various snippets of code I've ~~stole~~ _borrowed_. On that note, much thanks to Evan Chen for his awesome style files and Napkin!


Enjoy and do with them whatever you want to :) 
P.S. I know the code is messed up, especially in the style file.
