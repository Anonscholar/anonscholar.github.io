\chapter{Kinematics}

\para{Kinematics is the study of motion without concerning its cause. It allows
us to calculate and find out the evolution of a body. Everything in our world undergoes
motion, one way or the other. To begin our study of motion, let us first
concern ourselves with some definitions.}

\section{Reference Frame and Point Particle}

\para{Motion of any object is considered to relative to a reference frame. We consider motion of
any body with respect to any other body or co-ordiante frame.}
