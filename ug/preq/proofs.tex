\motiv{The basis of mathematics relies on proofs.}

\noindent Proofs are necessary for the study of higher mathematics. The notes for proofs are almost entirely based on \cite{proveit}. 
Mathematics itself is as a subject is based on \emph{deductive} logic. We start with a set of axioms and end with theorem,
conjectures, theorems, lemmas, etc. 

The language of proofs is therefore necessary for the study of higher mathematics, and thus this chapter is included at the 
start instead of being chucked away at the distance.
