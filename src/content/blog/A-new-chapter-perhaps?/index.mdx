Well, here it is, the second post on this series of blog posts I have decided to write, in some 
sense for my olympiad journey. Yes, it's a little late, I have an exam scheduled this Sunday and 
this week just did not go that well.

I had some health issues, coaching wrecked my routine twice by an abrupt change of timings, twice, so I 
just haven't been getting the study hours I would like to have. And well, part of it is just 
an excuse, I have not been working hard enough. But this is actually some nice thing about writing this, 
I can atleast hold myself accountable, I cannot afford something like this week again. I really 
_can't_. 

On the nicer side of things, even though I couldn't do much (electro)magnetism this week, 
I have been doing some thermo. Also was able to do more undergrad maths in the past 
week, which is always a good thing. On a less nicer side, I haven't been doings 
maths as much as I would like. This sunday will mark the last of it, I will ensure that.

Goals in the remaining two days are really just going to be fix my damned schedule, 
get back in the flow I was some time ago. Suprisingly, I might be able to fix 
chem very soon(which basically translates to in the next two weeks), so 
one thing to be happy about. I have a plan, and hey it's better than having no 
plan at least. 

So, there you go, that's a little underwhelming for a post that arrived later than the 
pretty comfortable time I had given myself, but these two weeks, especially 
the last one just has not been kind to me. Also yeah, thinking of adding some sort
of comments service. Tried disqus, did not work, though they did say to wait 
for 48 hours for the service to be completely up and running, well let's see. 

See you after some, hopefully, way better 14 days.
