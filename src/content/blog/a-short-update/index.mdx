Okay so continuing on the trend of breaking schedules, this comes out two days later than planned. yay.
But hey, I have a good excuse this time. Anyways, this will be a rather short post, mostly because 
I have RMO next week, and my anxiety is soaring.

So last week was rather dull, and I got burnt out a little, apparently it is not a good idea to 
only study or rot in my bed. Really lovely. But I am feeling better this week, and some things 
which I have tried are actually working, so that is pretty nice. Still overall,
didn't improve or do much last week. I won't make any more excuses, this series of blog posts 
is centered around honesty after all. I messed up, and well, now I must hold myself 
accountable.

I have also mostly solved problems last week (at least during the time I was not burnt out) for RMO,
so there is not much to say about it. Post-RMO, I may add problems I think are nice, and that illustrate
more soft-ideas. I am quite fond of a soft sort of intuition in olympiad mathematics, as opposed to 
hard techniques, so that would be fun to talk about.

I didn't do much physics, but also recently bought French's Waves and Vibrations, which I am quite excited to 
read once I am done with RMO. Overall, well, the last week was _bad_. There's no running around it.

I'll do my best to ensure this week is not, and I hope I feel a little fresh tomorrow, so that I can really 
give my all in RMO. On that note, to anyone giving RMO (and reading this of course), good luck! Let's do 
our best!

That's it for this week, the next update will also not come on Sunday because my center[^1] is 
a 3hr drive away, so I'll be dead tired. May add an analysis on RMO, something different from the 
usual updates, who knows.

See you on Monday.
