Welcome to the 4th blog in this series of posts (~~and also the first one where I did keep my promise about the schedule~~). 

Unlike last time there haven't been huge changes this week, but it's not like every week has to introduce great changes in my life.
I am getting better, and I am thankful for that. The main concern for this week was really regarding RMO, which is approaching in now what is exactly 
2 weeks. (Good luck to everyone who is giving it!). So let's get into a little bit of what I have been doing over the week.

## An overview of the week

Overall, I improved a fair bit this week. I have studied a fair bit more, and have been a little more consistent. I am not particularly 
happy with how the latter is going, so I'll try to make some decent changes here and there. Perhaps the thing that hinders it the most 
is that I often lost track of time, especially during the night which lead to a less than pleasant morning. I am more of a wake-up-early 
person. Though I do not study in the morning, I look to do some things to improve myself (as a person), and give a little bit of time 
to hobbies. That's beside the point, but an unpleasant morning always makes the day difficult for me.  

So I'll try to fix that by well actually trying to be aware, especially after dinner. That should lessen the issues. Another issue 
there maybe is my phone usage just before I go to sleep, so I think keeping my phone away at night would really help. 

Enough of that, lets talk about what I have done over the week. There is not a long list of topics I did this time,
especially because a lot of this week was really solving problems, but there are some of course.

While I am halfway done with electromagnetism at an introductory level, I had not yet done fluid mechanics, so I went over it for 
the most part. I read over both of the chapters in HRK, which with the problems and solving Griffiths took about three-ish days.  

On that note, I am now done with ~75% of chapter 1 exercises, and really only left with one non-trivial one. They're to be honest 
very bashy[^1], but at least the ones in chapter 2 are better. 

Other than I also read over wang and ricardo's chapter on fluids. It covers surface tension at a much greater depth than HRK, but I 
found the explanations to be very lacking a lot of times. Especially in the section of flotation, the diagram they have is quite messed up
and they directly write down the expression of the force due to surface tension which for the life I could not derive.

There is a factor of $\sin(3\pi/4 - \vartheta - \varphi)$ in there, but all my attempts at angle chasing have only been able to find the angle 
as $\pi - \vartheta - \varphi$. There is also a factor of $\sin\theta$ which I am not quite sure about the validity of, I got 
$\sin\phi$. And the diagram is just messed up. 

That formula has been annoying me for some time now. But it is fine, I'll assume I am not doing a simple angle chase wrong 
(which I did the day before yesterday), or messing up a simple expression (which I did today). It's alright.

I'll talk about math oly in the next section, so bear with me till then. Otherwise I worked a fair bit on pure mathematics,
its always fun to do it. And I suppose not much else in academics. Well, I really do think I should do some chemistry at least.

Now, with RMO this close, lets talk about my plans for RMO and beyond.

## Plans for (R)MO

A fair reminder, in the first blog post I mentioned I like math as much as like physics. That's true, but there is more to it than
that. I like _pure mathematics_ as much as I like physics. But I do _not_ like to work on _olympiad mathematics_ as much as
_olympiad physics_. To not offend anyone, let me be more clear. I very much like solving problems in mo. Its always interesting 
to sit with a problem and just think about it, as a puzzle. Math problems are ungrounded in reality, and you can play around with 
them as you want. It is a lot of fun to just sit and think about them.

But as I said earlier, I do not like olympiad mathematics as much as olympiad physics. The reason for it is nothing grand, 
olympiad mathematics is a fair bit different from pure mathematics. My reasons for liking mathematics as a whole are for the 
most part based around pure math. While I love to solve problems, I just do not want to grind math oly problems for 5 hours a day 
for the next year and a half or so. I want to do math oly, at least some of the more standard things, there is always something 
you can learn from the problems, but I really want to lessen the time I do it.

And so, post RMO, I will. I will be giving more of that time to physics and higher mathematics, things that I like more. But I won't
leave math oly, at least not until I go to college. I like it really, but there are other things that I just like _more_.

Now that that is off my chest, lets talk a little about RMO. I am not that worried about it really, I know where I stand in mo, and I think
if I just keep doing geometry as I have been for the past week, I will be fine. And well for the next two weeks I'll give math oly 
a fair bit of more time, because well RMO is approaching. I don't plan to be arrogant, there are a lot of things that could wrong, 
and you can always have a bad day, so I do not want to make fake promises, but I will do my best to do good in RMO, at the very least.

Also, as promised, here are the things I have done in mo, past week -- grinded geometry. Yes, that's it. I don't know what else am I supposed to say 
here really aside from this really. But okay, I think I'll be half-decent (able to solve RMO problems, at least) in a week or so. Which is pretty nice.
So yes, I grinded geo. A lot of geo, to be fair.

## Some reflections and a little bit about life

Being able to quit coaching to work on the things I love sounds like a very good outcome. And it truly is. But there is always more to things
than the obvious part. When I talk to someone about having quit coaching --- my parents, relatives, friends, I feel a knot in my chest. It
reminds me of the fact that I have taken the responsibility of my life in my hands. And if I do not work hard enough, if I fake effort, 
if I waste the chance I have finally got, there will be no excuses to give. No one else to blame.

I have always felt the weight of responsibility, even when I look at the responsibilites others have --- for
instance, my parents, regarding us (me and my brother). And this is a big responsibility. It has taught me to be a more honest, more
than anything.

Honest about my efforts, honest about improvements, my skills, and even how I am as a person. I haven't changed too much, there are a lot of things 
I need to do better, but I have at least been _a little more honest_. 

The heavy reflections aside, I said I'll talk a little about what I have been reading. This has been a long post, and so I'll talk 
just a little. I have been for the most part been reading _The Brothers Karamazov_ by _Fyodor Dostoevsky_. Its a wonderful book really,
and it teaches you a lot about life. It is of course, one of my favourite novels. I have heard nice things about 
Murakami too, so I have picked up his novel _Kafka at the Shore_ too. Its a really nice novel aside from Murakami just
adding plainly weird and unneeded explicit scenes, read it yourself, you'll get what I am talking about it. Could just be 
normal in Japan, I don't particularly know. 

I haven't read any decent manga this week, also going to stick to reading less of them, so there's that. I did not get 
the time to watch any anime this week, so I'll talk about that in the next week, I suppose.

That's all I had to say this week. I improved a little, and I hope in the next week I improve much more, and become 
happy about the contemporary state of things, more than the improvements. This was a longer blog post than usual, 
I hope you liked reading it. I am really grateful to everyone who read them!
