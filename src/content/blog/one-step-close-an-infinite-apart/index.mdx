This is the first post I am making on this website, and a quite heavy one --- atleast for me.
I have been interested in olympiads for somewhat more than a year, though the time I have dedicated to 
serious prep is somewhat less than that. 

I really like studying for both physics and math olympiads. A little bit of a rare sight, perhaps.
I am not really a "main" in either. I enjoy both almost equally, there are of course some periods in 
which I favour one, and some in which I favour the other.

This very nicely reflects the majors and career paths that I want to pursue too, but that is beside the point.
The thing is, my goal is of course, the international olympiads --- the IPhO and the IMO. The reason I am making 
these posts, is to hopefully document a journey that leads me there, or at the very least, teaches me more than 
I could've known not doing them. 

It is a hefty goal, and I need to work quite hard for it, hopefully this series of posts[^1] are going to keep me 
accountable to some extent, and perhaps they'll be of some use to others too. This is the first step to documenting this 
energy, and a lot more of the academic stuff I will do. That's well, it for this post, hopefully I'll have more to say 
in the next one. 

[^1]: _Hopefully_ the posts will come bi weekly, at least.
