Well, here is the promise update on Monday. The description of the post may have already revealed it to you, but my RMO did _not_ go well, *at all*. 

Before RMO, my attempt at RMO 23 had revealed it to me that I could do around 4 or 3.5ish problems at the minimum, so I was 
very comfortable with my chances of qualifying, and kind of slowed down before RMO, did not do may mocks, etc. And well, at RMO
I fucked up. I spend too long patching up my solution of p4 that I did not have time do many problems and came home having done 2 problems, and I am a little troubled with my solution in one of them too. 

After the exam, I can easily say I could’ve done 4 problems if I had just given up on my solution for p4. But I didn’t, and I am not even sure of qualifying now. I am not angry at what I did, I am just dissapointed at myself. So much that I could’ve done, so little have I done.

I know the issues that caused it, they aren’t profound realisations I have had after thinking for hours. The uncomfortable reality has always been inside my heart, reminding me of the weeds in the garden full of flowers. They’re simple really,

1. Did not do enough mocks.
2. Relaxed on practice too early.
3. Messed up balance on time distribution, that causes what I do to dilute.
4. Too much time spent on things other than my goals or hobbies.
5. Not enough reflection on problems.

They’re pretty generic reasons, but they’re the actual, true reasons. Truths are always boring, afterall. To be completely honest, the others posts I have made are all to someone else. They’re meant to tell the world about me. To make myself accountable to others. But this really is just a post to myself. I want to be dreadfully honest about what I feel, more than what I allow myself to be usually. 

I am tired. It was a bad day yesterday, and I am still tired. Its easy to say there’s nothing that I can do about it now. But its hard. There’s a pit in my stomach. I *am* sad *and* regretful. But I have also learned now. I hadn’t acknowledged the harsher things about what I had been doing, and that was how I messed up. I don’t want to mess up again, not like this. 

To anyone who has been rooting for me, really really thank you. Your expectations add a responsibility to my shoulders, the kind of one that does not make me collapse but instead makes me want to stand taller. *I will do it*. *I will accomplish my goals*. That’s what I want to tell you. Thank you, once again.

Couple of things that I have decided to change is to give a lot more mocks now. I have also felt the need to be organised lately, my preparation is all over the place. That’s what I have mostly been doing today, still work to do, but I will be done by today, I guess. I am also not going to be active on discord (except for some bl4s things) for a while. 

I want to work harder for my goals. Not everyone has the same privileges as me, I am lucky and I have the chance. I don’t want to let it go. That’s why I am sad. I’ll have to work harder, do better. That’s really what I feel.

A very downtrodden and honest post. I may add a post next week on RMO problems, well, at least the non-geometry ones. See you next week.
