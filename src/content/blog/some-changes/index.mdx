## Changes regarding the Blog

Well, I am late again. But its mostly because I had nothing to say, than anything, honestly. To some extent, that’s because I haven’t really added many of my well non-academic thoughts here, for various amounts of concerns. But recently, I think I have grown to think of this more as really just me getting out some of my thoughts, than strictly something that’s restricted to my journey in olympiads. So I’ll add stuff which pertaining to things such as philosophical topics, music and what not. I am whipping out this post quite quickly, right now, so I’ll add more of that later, in the next post, which I’ll work on this sunday.

Posts will be bi-weekly again, more higher quality but less burdensome on me. It’s not every week that I have some very interesting thing to talk about after all.

## NSEP, and RMO scores

RMO scores came out recently, mine were atrocious. Some part due to the checking, and mostly due to me. I choked in exam. Of course, I believe I could have done much better, I had the ability to solve 4-5 problems, it was just that I messed up my time management mid-exam. I will take more timed tests regularly now, qualify for INMO or not. Its nice to be able to solve good problems, but it also hurts when you fail at exams you most certainly know you could do very well in. :) Its time to move on and focus on things to come.

NSEP went well, fine. I think I choked a little in the first hour, but I did pretty decent in the second hour. Could’ve score a fair bit more if my hands weren’t shaking (both due to winter and the pressure) badly in the first hour, or if I had not been sick with a sudden stomach-ache in the middle of the exam. I feel like there’s just something with my health and exams. They never go hand in hand.

Also gave NSEA, which went a little less fine, I guess? I gave it mostly for just well, trying things out. Who knows, maybe I’ll qualify for INAO and not at INPHO? We’'ll see when the results come out.

Not much else to talk about, for now. May post again on Sunday, no promises. See you later.
