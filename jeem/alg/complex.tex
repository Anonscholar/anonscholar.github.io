\chapter{Complex Numbers}

We will begin our study of complex numbers in a little bit of a 
different manner. Instead of using algebraic form as the base, we will
define a complex number as,

\index{Complex Number}

\begin{definition}
    [Complex Numbers]
    An ordered pair, \((x, y)\) such that,
    \[
        z = (x, y) \in \RR^2 = \left\{(x, y) \mid x, y \in \RR \right\}
    \]
    is called a \emph{complex number}.
\end{definition}

\marginnote{The letter \(z\) is often used to denote a complex number.}

The operations addition and multiplication are defined simply as, 
\[
    z_1 + z_2 = (x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)
\]

\index{Complex Number!multiplication}
And multiplication is defined as,

\[
    z_1 \cdot z_2 = (x_1, y_1) \cdot (x_2, y_2) = (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2, x_1y_2 + x_2y_1)
\]

Although the definition of multiplication may seem complicated now, we will be able
to gain intuition for it after introducing the algebraic form of complex numbers.
