\section{Basic Definitions}

We'll begin our advent into chemistry by considering some basic definitions.


\begin{definition}
    The smallest independent unit of matter is an \vocab{atom}.
\end{definition}

I mention the term ``independent'' to highlight the fact that an atom is an independent unit. It can exist solely by itself. This is in contrast to 
more fundamental particles, which do not exist in stable forms independently.  

\begin{definition}
    When atoms combine chemically in fixed ratios, they are called \vocab{molecules}.
\end{definition}

Some example of molecules are, \(\ce{H2O}\), \(\ce{NH3}\), \dots
